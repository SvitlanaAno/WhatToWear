# WhatToWear

Application that recommends what to wear (multiple different looks with a set of clothes) based on the weather outside.

- Fetching data from the internet
- Build location-aware apps using FusedLocationProviderClient (GoogleApi)
- Thread Basics and AsyncTask
- Request runtime location permissions 
- Event handling
- Using ViewSwitcher and FrameLayout
